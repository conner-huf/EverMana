# EverMana
 A super-lightweight WoW addon made to display a druid's mana level for powershifting

I figure there are probably addons that do this, but they typically come with way too many other features. This just displays a little blue mana bar under your player frame no matter what form you're in. Useful for powershifting and not running out of mana to switch back into cat form.

Also, has a a pretty sweet name.

#### How to install an Addon:
- Open your file explorer and locate your World of Warcraft install location. (Look in "This PC", then any drives you may have installed into. The default is in "C:" in a folder titled "World of Warcraft".
- Double-click the folder and you'll find the different WoW versions. For this Addon, you'd be navigating to "classic_era".
- Double-click the folder for whichever version you're playing, then double-click the "Interface" folder.
- Double-click the "AddOns" folder.
- You can drag AddOns into this folder to install them.

- Mega Bonus Tip: If your game is open while doing all this, you'll have to type "/reload" in chat to load the addon. Once loaded, you can type "Thanks conner-huf! I love this add-on :)" in chat to be way cool.
