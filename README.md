# EverMana
 A super-lightweight WoW addon made to display a druid's mana level for powershifting

I figure there are probably addons that do this, but they typically come with way too many other features. This just displays a little blue mana bar under your player frame no matter what form you're in. Useful for powershifting and not running out of mana to switch back into cat form.

Also, has a a pretty sweet name.
